Format per entry: `## Cycle N — <UTC timestamp> — <track>` then: what/why,
evidence paths, canonical-pair numbers (overall a/b, delta), next hypothesis.

## Cycle 1 — 2026-07-23T01:18Z — METHOD (human-gated PR)

**What.** NOT-SCORABLE attribution fix. When NO pillar is observable (every
check NA/CANT_TEST/absent), the roll-up used to collapse to overall **0.0 /
grade F** — the worst-possible-storefront score — for a domain nobody could
even reach. It now reports NOT SCORABLE: `overall_score=None`, `grade="N/A"`,
new report field `scored=False`. Rubric bumped v0.4 -> v0.5 (aggregation-rule
change; dated changelog added).

**Why.** This is the aggregate-level expression of the attribution-honesty
invariant the per-check layer already honored ("a site is never punished for
what couldn't be observed"). A down/DNS-failing/probe-firewalled domain was
being mislabeled as a real F, indistinguishable from a genuinely failing
storefront — a false negative that pollutes any future leaderboard/population.
Discovered empirically: running the mandated canonical re-score in this
cloud env returned exactly this degenerate all-CANT_TEST result.

**Human-gated** per playbook ship-rule 5 (scoring-semantics/aggregation +
version bump). Branch `loop/not-scorable-attribution`, PR
[#1](https://github.com/jnakagawa/agentic-readiness/pull/1), Slack flagged.

**Scope.** asrs/{scoring,types,report,scorecard}.py, rubric/rubric_v0.yaml,
tests/test_scoring.py (new — first unit tests for the roll-up engine; 7 tests).
Strict no-op for any domain with >=1 observable pillar (branch unreachable when
weight_total > 0), so no real score moves.

**Evidence.**
- Tests: `tests/test_scoring.py` 7/7 PASS, `tests/test_free_tier.py` 8/8 PASS.
- Before/after render on the canonical pair (unreachable in-cloud): was
  "OVERALL 0.0/100 GRADE F", now "NOT SCORABLE — no observable pillars".
- Regression tests pin scorable scoring unchanged: single-pillar=100.0/A+,
  mixed=38.5/F, cap binds at 69.0.
- HTML scorecard renders null overall as "n/a" / "Grade N/A" (no crash).

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** LIVE static re-score is BLOCKED in this
cloud env: the agent proxy denies CONNECT to drift-flight.org / driftflight.com
/ any external host (403 — see loop/STATE.md). In-cloud both returned
NOT SCORABLE (all pillars unobservable). Delta unchanged is proven by
construction, not measured: the changed branch is unreachable for any domain
with an observable pillar, and a networked score of either canonical domain has
observable pillars. The live delta re-score is queued [LOCAL] for merge-time.

**Next hypothesis.** The stderr coverage-warning flood (one line per absent
rubric check, every run) is noise that will drown real signal once the battery
lands — a static-mode run legitimately omits all behavioral checks. Candidate
READOUT/METHOD cycle: suppress expected-absent warnings (behavioral checks in
static mode), keep only genuinely-unexpected ones.

## Cycle 2 — 2026-07-23T02:16Z — COVERAGE (direct to main)

**What.** Task-battery foundation: a battery file format + loader + cross-task
aggregation math, with tests. New `batteries/default_v1.yaml` (5 diverse
vendor-neutral intents: image gen, translation, data enrichment, API
subscription, physical good), `asrs/battery.py` (`load_battery`,
`aggregate_battery`, `Battery`/`BatteryTaskResult`/`BatterySummary`), and
`tests/test_battery.py` (6 tests). This is step one of the P0 COVERAGE battery
item ("design the format + aggregation first"); behavioral execution + the
`--battery` CLI flag stay [LOCAL] (need the claude/codex CLIs).

**Why.** A single shopper task is one draw from a wide distribution — a site's
readiness for "buy an image" says little about "subscribe to the API" or "order
the physical good." The battery turns "did it work once" into two signals a
single run can't give: COVERAGE (per-task, per-archetype checkpoint attainment)
and RELIABILITY (cross-task variance of each checkpoint). `cross_task_spread`
is the headline: 0 = the site behaves the same whatever the agent was sent to
do; higher = readiness is intent-dependent and the best single run overstates
it. Moves measurement flexibility (many intents) and rigor (variance-aware) at
once — both north-star axes.

**Invariant discipline.** Rubric is TASK-AGNOSTIC and UNCHANGED — the battery
adds NO check, weight, or cap and does not feed the overall score; it is a
diagnostic layer over the `BehavioralRun` records the shopper panel already
emits. So NO rubric version bump, and this is direct-to-main (new module +
data + tests, no scoring-semantics change, no payment/signing code). "Valid
run" + the checkpoint ladder are imported from `shopper` (single source of
truth) so the battery and the per-task score never diverge on what counts as
observing the site. The $0-only / one-free-tier-attempt property is untouched:
aggregation consumes already-collected runs. The [LOCAL] runner design (queued)
pins the constraint that the free-tier transaction probe fires at most ONCE per
battery while the shopper panel runs per task.

**Scope.** `asrs/battery.py` (new), `batteries/default_v1.yaml` (new),
`tests/test_battery.py` (new). No edits to scoring/cli/rubric/types/report — the
scoring path is byte-for-byte unchanged.

**Evidence.**
- Tests: `tests/test_battery.py` 6/6 PASS, `tests/test_free_tier.py` 8/8 PASS.
- Aggregation math pinned: env-blocked + failed runs excluded from valid (mirror
  of `shopper._aggregate`); no-valid-run task = "no signal" (None fractions),
  dropped from cross-task mean/spread, never a site failure; `pstdev` reliability
  spread (found_product identical across intents -> 0.0; 1.0-vs-0.0 intent split
  -> 0.5); single signal task -> spread 0.0 not a crash; missing task in runs
  map -> attempted 0 (no crash).
- Battery vendor-neutrality asserted in-test: no intent names a domain or brand.

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction, not merely
unmeasured. The scoring path imports nothing from `asrs/battery.py`; scoring.py,
cli.py, rubric_v0.yaml, types.py, report.py are untouched this cycle. No domain's
overall/pillars/delta can move. (Live re-score remains BLOCKED in-cloud per
STATE network policy; last known static-equivalent delta +40.6, queued [LOCAL].)

**Next hypothesis.** The battery only pays off once it runs. Next COVERAGE cycle
(after the TRUTH slot): wire `--battery <path>` into the behavioral pipeline —
static probes once, free-tier probe ONCE, shopper panel per task — attach the
`BatterySummary` to the Report as an additive field, and render the reliability
row. That touches the behavioral orchestration near the free-tier probe, so it
wants care but is still not a scoring-semantics change. Behavioral execution is
[LOCAL]; the CLI orchestration is testable in-cloud with a synthetic panel.

## Merge review — PR #1 (loop/not-scorable-attribution) — 2026-07-23T03:05Z

Reviewed and merged by the local operator (Fable session, networked machine)
under the new peer-gate policy. Live verification the authoring cycle could
not run in-cloud: tests 7/7 + 8/8 PASS on the branch; canonical pair static
re-score UNCHANGED vs the v0.4 baseline (drift-flight.org 46.1 F,
driftflight.com 85.5 B — exact no-op confirmed); degenerate case verified
live (unreachable domain now reports NOT SCORABLE instead of 0.0/F).
Refutation attempts: vendor-neutrality (clean — no domain named), attribution
honesty (this IS the invariant, aggregate level), version discipline (v0.5
bump + dated changelog present). Merged.

## Cycle 3 — 2026-07-23T03:16Z — TRUTH (direct to main)

**What.** Within-panel verdict-stability metric: `asrs/reliability.py`
(`panel_reliability(runs) -> PanelReliability`) + `tests/test_reliability.py`
(8 tests) + a PANEL RELIABILITY section in `report.render`. Over the VALID
shopper runs for one task (all model x trial draws that observed the site), it
computes per-checkpoint agreement (`max(pass, n-pass)/n`), a headline
`verdict_stability = 1 - 2*mean(minority_fraction)` in [0,1], the list of
`flipped_checkpoints`, `flip_rate`, and a separate `trust_event_agreement`
(the refuse/warn <-> clean flip). < 2 valid runs -> `single_trial`, all metrics
None, label `single-trial`/`no-signal` — the honest "not quotable yet" state.

**Why (TRUTH).** The open question in STATE: a same-day codex trust verdict
flipped refuse(0.97) <-> warn(0.97), and checkpoints can pass one trial and fail
the next. When the valid runs disagree, the aggregate the overall score quotes
is a point estimate over an unstable distribution and a single-trial number
overstates its own confidence. This makes reproducibility a first-class, visible
readout: does the panel say the same thing when you just run it again? It is the
WITHIN-PANEL complement to Cycle 2's CROSS-TASK battery spread — battery asks
"does readiness depend on the intent", reliability asks "does it reproduce on the
same intent". Directly serves "does the score predict what an agent experiences".

**Invariant discipline (mirrors Cycle 2 battery).** Rubric UNCHANGED — adds NO
check, weight, or cap and does NOT feed the overall score; a diagnostic layer
over the `BehavioralRun` records the panel already emits, so NO version bump and
direct-to-main. "Valid run" is imported from `asrs.behavioral.shopper`
(`_is_env_blocked`, `_CHECKPOINT_KEYS`) — single source of truth, so reliability
and the per-task score never diverge on what observed the site (env-blocked +
failed runs excluded identically). Vendor-neutral: no domain/brand string
anywhere; metric is pure arithmetic over checkpoint booleans. $0-only / free-tier
path untouched (consumes already-collected runs). Display-only render change.

**Scope.** `asrs/reliability.py` (new), `tests/test_reliability.py` (new),
`asrs/report.py` (render: new `_reliability_lines`, called after the behavioral
table). scoring.py / rubric_v0.yaml / types.py / cli.py / scorecard.py
byte-for-byte UNCHANGED (`git diff --stat` empty for all five).

**Evidence.**
- Full suite GREEN: test_scoring 7/7, test_free_tier 8/8, test_battery 6/6,
  test_reliability 8/8 (29/29). (free_tier needed `pip install -r
  requirements.txt` — `eth-account` absent in the fresh cloud container; a
  pre-existing env gap, not this change: 7/8 on clean main before install too.)
- Math pinned in-test: 2 unanimous runs -> stability 1.0 / flip_rate 0; one
  split checkpoint (1/2) -> stability 0.8, that checkpoint in `flipped_checkpoints`
  (ladder order); all-5-split -> 0.0; 3-run 2-split -> 0.733 "mixed"; trust flip
  is a SEPARATE dimension (checkpoints unanimous -> stability still 1.0);
  env-blocked + failed runs excluded from the valid denominator (mirrors shopper).
- Render smoke: a 2-run panel with one checkpoint + the trust signal flipping
  renders "verdict stability 0.80 (stable)", "flipped between runs:
  machine_payable_path", "trust signal flipped (agreement 0.50)".

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction, not merely
unmeasured: the scoring path (scoring.py, rubric, types.py, cli.py, scorecard.py)
is byte-for-byte untouched this cycle, so no domain's overall/pillars/delta can
move. Live in-cloud re-score remains BLOCKED (agent proxy denies external
CONNECT, STATE network policy); last known static-equivalent delta +40.6, live
re-score queued [LOCAL].

**Next hypothesis (READOUT is next in rotation).** Reliability is computed only
in `render` today — the JSON Report and the HTML scorecard don't carry it.
Next READOUT cycle: attach `PanelReliability` (and the Cycle-2 `BatterySummary`)
to `Report` as additive fields and surface a reliability row on the HTML card,
so JSON/leaderboard consumers see reproducibility, not just the terminal. Still
additive, no version bump. Open science question for a [LOCAL] run: what trial
count N drives `verdict_stability` above ~0.8 on the canonical pair — the
empirical answer to "what N stabilizes it".
