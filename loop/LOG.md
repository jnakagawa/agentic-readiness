# Cycle log (append-only; never edit past entries)

Format per entry: `## Cycle N — <UTC timestamp> — <track>` then: what/why,
evidence paths, canonical-pair numbers (overall a/b, delta), next hypothesis.

## Cycle 1 — 2026-07-23T01:18Z — METHOD (human-gated PR)

**What.** NOT-SCORABLE attribution fix. When NO pillar is observable (every
check NA/CANT_TEST/absent), the roll-up used to collapse to overall **0.0 /
grade F** — the worst-possible-storefront score — for a domain nobody could
even reach. It now reports NOT SCORABLE: `overall_score=None`, `grade="N/A"`,
new report field `scored=False`. Rubric bumped v0.4 -> v0.5 (aggregation-rule
change; dated changelog added).

**Why.** This is the aggregate-level expression of the attribution-honesty
invariant the per-check layer already honored ("a site is never punished for
what couldn't be observed"). A down/DNS-failing/probe-firewalled domain was
being mislabeled as a real F, indistinguishable from a genuinely failing
storefront — a false negative that pollutes any future leaderboard/population.
Discovered empirically: running the mandated canonical re-score in this
cloud env returned exactly this degenerate all-CANT_TEST result.

**Human-gated** per playbook ship-rule 5 (scoring-semantics/aggregation +
version bump). Branch `loop/not-scorable-attribution`, PR
[#1](https://github.com/jnakagawa/agentic-readiness/pull/1), Slack flagged.

**Scope.** asrs/{scoring,types,report,scorecard}.py, rubric/rubric_v0.yaml,
tests/test_scoring.py (new — first unit tests for the roll-up engine; 7 tests).
Strict no-op for any domain with >=1 observable pillar (branch unreachable when
weight_total > 0), so no real score moves.

**Evidence.**
- Tests: `tests/test_scoring.py` 7/7 PASS, `tests/test_free_tier.py` 8/8 PASS.
- Before/after render on the canonical pair (unreachable in-cloud): was
  "OVERALL 0.0/100 GRADE F", now "NOT SCORABLE — no observable pillars".
- Regression tests pin scorable scoring unchanged: single-pillar=100.0/A+,
  mixed=38.5/F, cap binds at 69.0.
- HTML scorecard renders null overall as "n/a" / "Grade N/A" (no crash).

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** LIVE static re-score is BLOCKED in this
cloud env: the agent proxy denies CONNECT to drift-flight.org / driftflight.com
/ any external host (403 — see loop/STATE.md). In-cloud both returned
NOT SCORABLE (all pillars unobservable). Delta unchanged is proven by
construction, not measured: the changed branch is unreachable for any domain
with an observable pillar, and a networked score of either canonical domain has
observable pillars. The live delta re-score is queued [LOCAL] for merge-time.

**Next hypothesis.** The stderr coverage-warning flood (one line per absent
rubric check, every run) is noise that will drown real signal once the battery
lands — a static-mode run legitimately omits all behavioral checks. Candidate
READOUT/METHOD cycle: suppress expected-absent warnings (behavioral checks in
static mode), keep only genuinely-unexpected ones.

## Cycle 2 — 2026-07-23T02:16Z — COVERAGE (direct to main)

**What.** Task-battery foundation: a battery file format + loader + cross-task
aggregation math, with tests. New `batteries/default_v1.yaml` (5 diverse
vendor-neutral intents: image gen, translation, data enrichment, API
subscription, physical good), `asrs/battery.py` (`load_battery`,
`aggregate_battery`, `Battery`/`BatteryTaskResult`/`BatterySummary`), and
`tests/test_battery.py` (6 tests). This is step one of the P0 COVERAGE battery
item ("design the format + aggregation first"); behavioral execution + the
`--battery` CLI flag stay [LOCAL] (need the claude/codex CLIs).

**Why.** A single shopper task is one draw from a wide distribution — a site's
readiness for "buy an image" says little about "subscribe to the API" or "order
the physical good." The battery turns "did it work once" into two signals a
single run can't give: COVERAGE (per-task, per-archetype checkpoint attainment)
and RELIABILITY (cross-task variance of each checkpoint). `cross_task_spread`
is the headline: 0 = the site behaves the same whatever the agent was sent to
do; higher = readiness is intent-dependent and the best single run overstates
it. Moves measurement flexibility (many intents) and rigor (variance-aware) at
once — both north-star axes.

**Invariant discipline.** Rubric is TASK-AGNOSTIC and UNCHANGED — the battery
adds NO check, weight, or cap and does not feed the overall score; it is a
diagnostic layer over the `BehavioralRun` records the shopper panel already
emits. So NO rubric version bump, and this is direct-to-main (new module +
data + tests, no scoring-semantics change, no payment/signing code). "Valid
run" + the checkpoint ladder are imported from `shopper` (single source of
truth) so the battery and the per-task score never diverge on what counts as
observing the site. The $0-only / one-free-tier-attempt property is untouched:
aggregation consumes already-collected runs. The [LOCAL] runner design (queued)
pins the constraint that the free-tier transaction probe fires at most ONCE per
battery while the shopper panel runs per task.

**Scope.** `asrs/battery.py` (new), `batteries/default_v1.yaml` (new),
`tests/test_battery.py` (new). No edits to scoring/cli/rubric/types/report — the
scoring path is byte-for-byte unchanged.

**Evidence.**
- Tests: `tests/test_battery.py` 6/6 PASS, `tests/test_free_tier.py` 8/8 PASS.
- Aggregation math pinned: env-blocked + failed runs excluded from valid (mirror
  of `shopper._aggregate`); no-valid-run task = "no signal" (None fractions),
  dropped from cross-task mean/spread, never a site failure; `pstdev` reliability
  spread (found_product identical across intents -> 0.0; 1.0-vs-0.0 intent split
  -> 0.5); single signal task -> spread 0.0 not a crash; missing task in runs
  map -> attempted 0 (no crash).
- Battery vendor-neutrality asserted in-test: no intent names a domain or brand.

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction, not merely
unmeasured. The scoring path imports nothing from `asrs/battery.py`; scoring.py,
cli.py, rubric_v0.yaml, types.py, report.py are untouched this cycle. No domain's
overall/pillars/delta can move. (Live re-score remains BLOCKED in-cloud per
STATE network policy; last known static-equivalent delta +40.6, queued [LOCAL].)

**Next hypothesis.** The battery only pays off once it runs. Next COVERAGE cycle
(after the TRUTH slot): wire `--battery <path>` into the behavioral pipeline —
static probes once, free-tier probe ONCE, shopper panel per task — attach the
`BatterySummary` to the Report as an additive field, and render the reliability
row. That touches the behavioral orchestration near the free-tier probe, so it
wants care but is still not a scoring-semantics change. Behavioral execution is
[LOCAL]; the CLI orchestration is testable in-cloud with a synthetic panel.

## Merge review — PR #1 (loop/not-scorable-attribution) — 2026-07-23T03:05Z

Reviewed and merged by the local operator (Fable session, networked machine)
under the new peer-gate policy. Live verification the authoring cycle could
not run in-cloud: tests 7/7 + 8/8 PASS on the branch; canonical pair static
re-score UNCHANGED vs the v0.4 baseline (drift-flight.org 46.1 F,
driftflight.com 85.5 B — exact no-op confirmed); degenerate case verified
live (unreachable domain now reports NOT SCORABLE instead of 0.0/F).
Refutation attempts: vendor-neutrality (clean — no domain named), attribution
honesty (this IS the invariant, aggregate level), version discipline (v0.5
bump + dated changelog present). Merged.

## Cycle 3 — 2026-07-23T03:16Z — TRUTH (direct to main)

**What.** Within-panel verdict-stability metric: `asrs/reliability.py`
(`panel_reliability(runs) -> PanelReliability`) + `tests/test_reliability.py`
(8 tests) + a PANEL RELIABILITY section in `report.render`. Over the VALID
shopper runs for one task (all model x trial draws that observed the site), it
computes per-checkpoint agreement (`max(pass, n-pass)/n`), a headline
`verdict_stability = 1 - 2*mean(minority_fraction)` in [0,1], the list of
`flipped_checkpoints`, `flip_rate`, and a separate `trust_event_agreement`
(the refuse/warn <-> clean flip). < 2 valid runs -> `single_trial`, all metrics
None, label `single-trial`/`no-signal` — the honest "not quotable yet" state.

**Why (TRUTH).** The open question in STATE: a same-day codex trust verdict
flipped refuse(0.97) <-> warn(0.97), and checkpoints can pass one trial and fail
the next. When the valid runs disagree, the aggregate the overall score quotes
is a point estimate over an unstable distribution and a single-trial number
overstates its own confidence. This makes reproducibility a first-class, visible
readout: does the panel say the same thing when you just run it again? It is the
WITHIN-PANEL complement to Cycle 2's CROSS-TASK battery spread — battery asks
"does readiness depend on the intent", reliability asks "does it reproduce on the
same intent". Directly serves "does the score predict what an agent experiences".

**Invariant discipline (mirrors Cycle 2 battery).** Rubric UNCHANGED — adds NO
check, weight, or cap and does NOT feed the overall score; a diagnostic layer
over the `BehavioralRun` records the panel already emits, so NO version bump and
direct-to-main. "Valid run" is imported from `asrs.behavioral.shopper`
(`_is_env_blocked`, `_CHECKPOINT_KEYS`) — single source of truth, so reliability
and the per-task score never diverge on what observed the site (env-blocked +
failed runs excluded identically). Vendor-neutral: no domain/brand string
anywhere; metric is pure arithmetic over checkpoint booleans. $0-only / free-tier
path untouched (consumes already-collected runs). Display-only render change.

**Scope.** `asrs/reliability.py` (new), `tests/test_reliability.py` (new),
`asrs/report.py` (render: new `_reliability_lines`, called after the behavioral
table). scoring.py / rubric_v0.yaml / types.py / cli.py / scorecard.py
byte-for-byte UNCHANGED (`git diff --stat` empty for all five).

**Evidence.**
- Full suite GREEN: test_scoring 7/7, test_free_tier 8/8, test_battery 6/6,
  test_reliability 8/8 (29/29). (free_tier needed `pip install -r
  requirements.txt` — `eth-account` absent in the fresh cloud container; a
  pre-existing env gap, not this change: 7/8 on clean main before install too.)
- Math pinned in-test: 2 unanimous runs -> stability 1.0 / flip_rate 0; one
  split checkpoint (1/2) -> stability 0.8, that checkpoint in `flipped_checkpoints`
  (ladder order); all-5-split -> 0.0; 3-run 2-split -> 0.733 "mixed"; trust flip
  is a SEPARATE dimension (checkpoints unanimous -> stability still 1.0);
  env-blocked + failed runs excluded from the valid denominator (mirrors shopper).
- Render smoke: a 2-run panel with one checkpoint + the trust signal flipping
  renders "verdict stability 0.80 (stable)", "flipped between runs:
  machine_payable_path", "trust signal flipped (agreement 0.50)".

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction, not merely
unmeasured: the scoring path (scoring.py, rubric, types.py, cli.py, scorecard.py)
is byte-for-byte untouched this cycle, so no domain's overall/pillars/delta can
move. Live in-cloud re-score remains BLOCKED (agent proxy denies external
CONNECT, STATE network policy); last known static-equivalent delta +40.6, live
re-score queued [LOCAL].

**Next hypothesis (READOUT is next in rotation).** Reliability is computed only
in `render` today — the JSON Report and the HTML scorecard don't carry it.
Next READOUT cycle: attach `PanelReliability` (and the Cycle-2 `BatterySummary`)
to `Report` as additive fields and surface a reliability row on the HTML card,
so JSON/leaderboard consumers see reproducibility, not just the terminal. Still
additive, no version bump. Open science question for a [LOCAL] run: what trial
count N drives `verdict_stability` above ~0.8 on the canonical pair — the
empirical answer to "what N stabilizes it".

## Cycle 4 — 2026-07-23T04:15Z — READOUT (direct to main)

**What.** Surfaced the within-panel verdict-reliability metric — computed only
inside the terminal renderer since Cycle 3 — in the JSON `Report` and the HTML
scorecard. `Report` gains one ADDITIVE field, `panel_reliability: dict | None`
(the `asrs.reliability.PanelReliability` as a plain dict). `cli._evaluate`
populates it after scoring from the SAME `behavioral_runs` via the SAME pure
`panel_reliability()` the terminal calls, so JSON/HTML and the terminal card
never diverge. `scorecard._reliability(rep)` renders a brand-styled "Panel
reliability" card (stability number + band pill, flipped checkpoints shown by
human label, the trust-signal flip note) wired into both the single-domain
column and the side-by-side compare layout. `tests/test_readout.py` (5 tests).

**Why (READOUT).** The reliability signal answered "does the panel reproduce on
the same task?" but only in the terminal — the JSON a leaderboard/consumer reads
and the hosted HTML card carried the high-delta number with no reproducibility
context beside it. A quoted stability that lives only in a terminal a human ran
once is not a benchmark readout. This puts reproducibility next to the score
everywhere the score travels, so a reader sees whether a number rests on runs
that agree or runs that flip between trials. Serves readout clarity directly.

**Scope decision (why reliability only, not battery too).** The backlog item
paired reliability + battery attach. `BatterySummary` has NO populated source in
the current pipeline — `--battery` wiring is `[LOCAL]`-gated behavioral work — so
attaching it now would create a permanently-null dead field. `PanelReliability`
is genuinely populatable in-cloud today (`behavioral_runs` sit on every
behavioral Report), so it is the smallest scientifically meaningful unit that
actually carries data. Battery-attach stays queued behind `--battery`.

**Invariant discipline.** Rubric UNCHANGED — adds NO check, weight, or cap and
does NOT feed the overall score. `git diff --stat asrs/scoring.py rubric/` is
EMPTY (byte-for-byte). The new `types.py` field is optional, default None,
scoring-irrelevant → NO rubric version bump, direct-to-main. Vendor-neutral: the
card is pure arithmetic over checkpoint booleans, no domain/brand string; the
smoke render used driftflight.com only as a fixture label. $0-only / free-tier
path untouched (consumes already-collected runs). Static reports carry
`panel_reliability = None` — no invented reproducibility for a panel that never
ran (attribution honesty).

**Evidence.**
- Full suite GREEN 34/34: test_readout 5/5, test_reliability 8/8, test_battery
  6/6, test_scoring 7/7, test_free_tier 8/8 (free_tier needed `pip install -r
  requirements.txt` — `eth-account` absent in the fresh cloud container, the
  same pre-existing env gap logged in Cycle 3; 7/8 before install, 8/8 after).
- test_readout pins: a 2-run panel (one checkpoint split) round-trips through
  `to_json`/`json.loads` with `verdict_stability` 0.8 and
  `flipped_checkpoints == ["machine_payable_path"]`; the stored dict is
  byte-for-byte `panel_reliability(runs).to_dict()` (one source of truth); a
  static report serializes `panel_reliability = None`; the HTML card shows
  "0.80"/"Stable"/"Machine-payable" and never leaks the raw key; single-trial →
  "Single trial"/"not assessed" (no fake number); absent field → empty string
  (static scorecards byte-identical).
- End-to-end smoke: `build_scorecard` on a synthetic behavioral report emits the
  "Panel reliability" card with stability 0.80 and the flipped-checkpoint chip.

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction: the scoring
path (scoring.py, rubric, plus the scoring-relevant types.py fields) is
byte-for-byte untouched, so no domain's overall/pillar/delta can move. LIVE
signal from the freshest local-verify artifact (runs/local/verify_20260723T040757Z.json,
~7 min old at cycle time — runner healthy): drift-flight.org 46.1 F vs
driftflight.com 85.5 B, delta +39.4 — matching the by-construction expectation
of no movement.

**Next hypothesis (METHOD is next in rotation).** With reproducibility now
visible in the JSON, the natural METHOD step is to make trials>=2 the behavioral
default and gate the QUOTABILITY of a single number on `single_trial` /
`verdict_stability` (a readout-level "provisional (single trial)" tag, NOT a
score change). Open [LOCAL] science question unchanged: what trial count N drives
`verdict_stability` above ~0.8 on the canonical pair. Battery attach remains
queued behind `--battery` wiring (COVERAGE, partially in-cloud testable with a
synthetic panel).

## Cycle 5 — 2026-07-23T05:20Z — METHOD (direct to main)

**What.** A quotability gate: a display-only readout that tells a reader, in one
bit, whether a Report's headline number is safe to CITE or only PROVISIONAL,
and defaulted behavioral `--trials` to 2 so a quoted behavioral number is
reproducibility-checked by default instead of a single draw. New pure function
`asrs.reliability.quotability(report)` -> `Quotability(quotable, tag, reason,
verdict_stability)`, classifying six honest states over the runs the score
already used: `static-deterministic` (no panel -> reproducible by construction ->
CITABLE), `reproducible` (multi-trial panel agreed -> CITABLE), `provisional-
single-trial` (one valid draw -> reproducibility unmeasured), `provisional-
unstable` (multi-trial panel whose runs disagree, `verdict_stability` < 0.8),
`behavioral-unobserved` (`--behavioral` asked but every run env-blocked/failed),
`not-scorable` (no observable pillar -> no number to quote). Surfaced as one
`QUOTABILITY:` line under the OVERALL header in the terminal card
(`report._quotability_lines`). `--trials` default 1 -> 2.

**Why (METHOD).** The Cycle-3/4 reliability metric made verdict flips *visible*
but left the interpretation to the reader: a card could print a high delta next
to a stability of 0.0 and still read as authoritative. This operationalizes the
loop's own finding — the observed same-day refuse<->warn flip at equal
confidence proves a single trial is not quotable — into a verdict the readout
states itself. "Multi-trial the scored default for anything quoted" (backlog
METHOD item) is now the literal default: a bare `--behavioral` run collects 2
trials, and if it still can't reproduce, the number self-flags PROVISIONAL. This
is the honest gate between "we measured it once" and "cite this."

**Invariant discipline.** NOT a scoring-semantics change -> NO version bump,
direct-to-main. `git diff --stat asrs/scoring.py rubric/` is EMPTY (byte-for-
byte); `types.py` untouched. Quotability does NOT feed the score — `render`
shows the SAME `overall_score`, asserted unchanged in-test. Vendor-neutral: pure
arithmetic over checkpoint booleans + panel counts, no domain/brand string.
$0-only preserved: `--trials 2` repeats ONLY the read-only shopper panel; the
free-tier transaction probe still runs at most ONCE per scoring run (it sits
outside the trials loop in `cli._run_behavioral`; help text now says so
explicitly). Attribution honesty: a static-only score is `static-deterministic`
(CITABLE, never flagged), and an all-env-blocked panel is scoped to
`behavioral-unobserved` — it judges the behavioral dimension, NOT the static
floor the overall degrades to; a not-scorable report prints no quotability line.
Terminal-only this cycle (mirrors the Cycle-3 reliability pattern: metric +
terminal card first, JSON/HTML attach next READOUT cycle) — JSON `to_json()`
byte-identical, so the local-verify artifact contract is unchanged.

**Scope.** `asrs/reliability.py` (+`Quotability` dataclass + `quotability()`),
`asrs/report.py` (`_quotability_lines`, one line under the header),
`asrs/cli.py` (`--trials` default 1->2 + help text), `tests/test_quotability.py`
(new, 8 tests). 3 source files + 1 test; scoring.py/rubric/types.py/scorecard.py
UNCHANGED.

**Evidence.**
- Full suite GREEN 42/42: test_quotability 8/8, test_readout 5/5,
  test_reliability 8/8, test_battery 6/6, test_scoring 7/7, test_free_tier 8/8
  (free_tier needs `pip install -r requirements.txt` — `eth-account` absent in
  the fresh cloud container, the same pre-existing env gap logged Cycles 3-4).
- Render smoke (LOG evidence): a static B report prints "QUOTABILITY: CITABLE
  (static-deterministic)" beside an unchanged "OVERALL 85.5/100"; a single-trial
  behavioral report prints "QUOTABILITY: PROVISIONAL (provisional-single-trial)
  … re-run with --trials>=2"; a two-run disagreeing panel prints "PROVISIONAL
  (provisional-unstable) — verdict stability 0.00 < 0.80".
- test_quotability pins: static -> CITABLE/no stability; not-scorable -> no
  QUOTABILITY line in the card; 1 valid run -> provisional-single-trial with the
  --trials>=2 pointer; 2 disagreeing runs -> provisional-unstable carrying
  stability 0.0; 2 agreeing runs -> reproducible carrying 1.0; all-env-blocked ->
  behavioral-unobserved scoped to the behavioral dimension; overall score
  byte-unchanged in the rendered card; CLI `--trials` default parses to 2.

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** UNCHANGED by construction: scoring.py,
rubric, and types.py are byte-for-byte untouched, so no domain's overall/pillar/
delta can move. LIVE signal from the freshest local-verify artifact
(runs/local/verify_20260723T040757Z.json, ~1h old at cycle time — runner
healthy): drift-flight.org 46.1 F vs driftflight.com 85.5 B, delta +39.4 —
matching the by-construction expectation of no movement (both re-scored static:
outcome pillar None on each, so both read `static-deterministic` / CITABLE, and
the delta is unaffected). Live in-cloud re-score remains BLOCKED (network policy);
`[LOCAL]` re-score stays queued.

**Next hypothesis (COVERAGE is next in rotation).** With quotability + trials>=2
default landed, the outstanding METHOD `[LOCAL]` question is empirical: what
trial count N drives `verdict_stability` >= 0.8 on the canonical pair (queued).
COVERAGE next: the `--battery` wiring (synthetic-panel testable in-cloud) is the
oldest COVERAGE follow-up and would let a per-task quotability/reliability grid
travel with the score — the natural COVERAGE companion to this cycle's METHOD
gate.

## Local cycle — 2026-07-23T05:52Z — METHOD (merge-verify; no code change)

**What.** Discharged the oldest P0: the `[LOCAL]` merge-time canonical re-score
for PR [#1](https://github.com/jnakagawa/agentic-readiness/pull/1)
(`loop/not-scorable-attribution`, v0.5 NOT SCORABLE), which was peer-gated and
merged 2026-07-23T03:00:15Z **without** its required live canonical-delta
verification — the cloud env has no outbound network to the canonical domains,
so that sensitive-class merge check was queued for a networked operator. This
local (networked) fire ran it deliberately and live.

**Why.** v0.5 was a scoring-semantics/aggregation change. The playbook's
sensitive-class rule (weights/caps/removals + version bump) requires the live
canonical-delta effect be shown at merge time; it had only ever been argued
by construction + the automated hourly runner, never recorded as the deliberate
peer-gate verification. Recording it closes the audit gap for a merged
scoring-semantics PR.

**Method + evidence.**
- Full suite GREEN 42/42 (`.venv`, eth-account present locally): test_battery
  6/6, test_free_tier 8/8, test_quotability 8/8, test_readout 5/5,
  test_reliability 8/8, test_scoring 7/7.
- Live static re-score (this machine; both domains HTTP 200 in <1s):
  drift-flight.org **46.1 F** (scored) vs driftflight.com **85.5 B** (scored),
  delta **+39.4**. Reachable domains score NORMALLY — not NOT-SCORABLE —
  proving the v0.5 change is a no-op for them.
- Unreachable-domain CONTROL (`*.invalid`): overall=None, grade=N/A,
  scored=False -> NOT SCORABLE. Demonstrates the v0.5 path fires ONLY when no
  pillar is observable (the change's exact claimed semantics).
- Evidence: `runs/local/merge_verify_pr1_20260723T055000Z.json`; report blobs
  `runs/drift-flight_org_20260723T054805.json`,
  `runs/driftflight_com_20260723T054811.json`,
  `runs/asrs-nonexistent-control-20260723_invalid_20260723T054831.json`.

**Canonical pair (regression signal).** 46.1 F / 85.5 B, delta +39.4 — matches
the freshest hourly verify artifact (`verify_20260723T040757Z.json`) exactly and
sits within static variance of the loop-start baseline +40.6. No regression;
delta explained in capability terms — access/trust identical (100/60 each on
both), the +39.4 is entirely the .com's agent-native legibility (90.9 vs 36.4)
and transactability (87.5 vs 18.8) the .org lacks.

**Ship.** Direct-to-main (verification + evidence artifact + LOG/STATE/BACKLOG
only; `asrs/` untouched — no source/scoring change). Oldest P0 removed from
BACKLOG. Cloud cycle counter (5) and focus pointer (COVERAGE) unchanged — a
local fire executes queued `[LOCAL]` work, it does not rotate the cloud track.

**Cost finding (steers the next local fire).** `SHOPPER_TIMEOUT_S = 300` per
model×trial makes the queued behavioral experiments multi-cycle-scale: the
N-sweep item as written (N=2,3,5 × claude,codex on both domains) is ~100 min and
~20 codex invocations — over both the "one behavioral pair run" and "~10 codex"
budgets. Recommend the next local fire take a SINGLE scoped datapoint
(drift-flight.org, `--trials 2`, claude,codex ≈ 15-20 min) — the first N=2
reliability + quotability observation on LIVE data (validating the Cycle 3-5
metrics for the first time on real panels) — and split the N-sweep across fires.
Run drift-flight.org (the codex-refusal-free canonical domain) first so codex
browser refusals don't confound the timing.
